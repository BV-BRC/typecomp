1.  perl Makefile.PL
2.  make
3.  make test
4.  make install

You will need administrative privileges to install
in the default location. See the documentation on
Module::Build to specificy an alternative location.

TESTING:

For now, testing involves running the compiler
on a Interface Description Document (IDD). An IDD
is provided in the dist/t directory. Assuming
the compiler is installed in /usr/local/bin you
can run a simple test manually like this:

/usr/local/bin/compile_typespec.pl 

NON STANDARD INSTALLATION LOCATION (Untested at this
time)

1.  perl Makefile.PL BASE_DIR=/var/tmp/local
2.  make
3.  make test
4.  make install
