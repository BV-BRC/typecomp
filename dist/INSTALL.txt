2.  ./Build installdeps
3.  ./Build

You will need administrative privileges to install
in the default location. See the documentation on
Module::Build to specificy an alternative location.

TESTING:

For now, testing involves running the compiler
on a Interface Description Document (IDD). An IDD
is provided in the dist/t directory. Assuming
the compiler is installed in /usr/local/bin you
can run a simple test like this:

/usr/local/bin/compile_typespec.pl
