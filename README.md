 # BV-BRC Type Compiler

The BV-BRC Type Compiler consumes a type-document and produces a
server and implementation libraries in one language and client
libraries in multiple supported languages. This mechanism is used for the synchronous XMLRPC-based services such
as the [genome annotation](https://github.com/TheSEED/genome_annotation) and [similar genoem finder](https://github.com/BV-BRC/p3_minhash) services.

## About this module

This module is a component of the BV-BRC build system. It is designed to fit into the
`dev_container` infrastructure which manages development and production deployment of
the components of the BV-BRC. More documentation is available [here](https://github.com/BV-BRC/dev_container/tree/master/README.md).


## Usage

This module generates two executables to compile specification
documents into client/server libraries:

    compile_typespec
    compile_dbd_to_typespec

Run these commands with no arguments for usage information.

## Development


**Do not modify** the following files directly, as they are
automatically generated by Parse::Yapp based on the corresponding
yp file in the top level of the repository:

    lib/Bio/KBase/KIDL/erdoc.pm
    lib/Bio/KBase/KIDL/typedoc.pm

To recompile the grammars, run "make".
